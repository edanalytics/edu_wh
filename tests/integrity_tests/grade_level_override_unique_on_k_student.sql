/*
**What is this test?**
This test finds records where a grade_level_override for dim_student is NOT unique on k_student. If true,
the grain of dim_student could be blown up in a dangerous way, because of the join in bld_ef3__stu_grade_level

**When is this important to resolve?**
Immediately, if any rows are returned.

**How to resolve?**
Update the model used as a grade_level_override source to ensure it is unique on k_student (or make a build model for that purpose).
