      "**What is this test?** This test returns if any records at a school/year in fct_student_school_association are
        a) missing a valid calendar association
        b) at a school that has >1 valid calendar

      **When is this important to resolve?**
      This is always important for attendance metrics, because we need to be able to associate a student-school enrollment to a calendar, to know which days the student was enrolled and in attendance.

      **How to resolve?**
      a) Ask the tenant or SIS vendor to make sure calendarReference is populating for all records in studentSchoolAssociations
      b) (less likely) Ask the tenant or SIS vendor to remove any invalid calendars at the relevant schools"
