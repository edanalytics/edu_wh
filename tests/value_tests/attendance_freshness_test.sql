/*
**What is this test?**
This test finds records where attendance data for a tenant is stale (> 7 days old).
This could be due to issues syncing from source system to ODS or from ODS
to warehouse.

**When is this important to resolve?**
When up-to-date daily attendance is reported.

**How to resolve?**
Check whether there are errors pulling attendance records from ODS, 
or if there are errors pushing data from source system to ODS.
