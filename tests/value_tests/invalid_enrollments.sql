/*
**What is this test?**
This test finds records where student-school association data have 
"invalid" values, because the student:
a) exited before the first day of school (sometimes "invalid" for analytics)
b) exited before entry date (should be impossible)
c) have a withdraw code that denotes an invalid enrollment record

**When is this important to resolve?**
Sometimes these records will simply be reality, e.g. students who withdraw
before the school year starts. However, if these reflect data errors from the
source system (likely the case for b) above), they should be resolved.

**How to resolve?**
Determine from the source system whether these records are accurate, and if not,
debug the source system or contact its administrator.
