/*
**What is this test?**
This test finds records where there are multiple attendance event records per student-school-calendar date.
These duplicates are handled in fct_student_daily_attendance, but they may point to data quality issues that 
could be addressed in the source system or ODS.

**When is this important to resolve?**
When the duplicates are signs of source system errors, e.g. Absent is corrected with Tardy, then Absent record should
actually be deleted from ODS. The warehouse does its best to handle these cases, but correcting in ODS is always preferred.

**How to resolve?**
Depends on the case, but once issue is diagnosed, you might resolve that issue and also clean up ODS by deleting the "corrected"
records.
