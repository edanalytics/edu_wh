    We bring in this table to get the `k_school_calendar` we need to turn
    `attendance_event_date` into `k_calendar_date`. Because a student could have
    multiple enrollments at the same school in the same year, we specify the join
    such that the attendance_event_date is within the range of the enrolmment's
    entry_date and exit_withdraw_date. This accounts for the case where a student's
    multiple enrollments each made use of different calendars. However, if a 
    student has overlapping enrollments at the same school, multiple rows will
    be returned for each date. Therefore we must introduce a deduplication step.
