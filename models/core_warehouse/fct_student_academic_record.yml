      ##### Overview:
        Represents the cumulative record of academic achievement for a student, up to the specified academic term.

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_student_academic_record` -- There is one record per student, education organization (usually school or LEA), 
        and academic term.

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        `k_student` is an annualized student identifier, so it will be null unless there is a student record for the relevant school year.

      ##### Example Use Cases:
        To join to `dim_student` without dropping the records where `k_student` is null (i.e., those without `dim_student` data for the
        year of the academic record), it is necessary to join on `k_student_xyear` and include some logic to determine which year of
        student data should be used. One way to do this is using the `is_latest_record` indicator. For example, if a student was most recently
        enrolled in 2021, then all academic records - regardless of the year of the data - will be joined to the 2021 `dim_student` record.
