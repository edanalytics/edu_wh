      ##### Overview:
        Represents the cumulative record of academic achievement for a student, up to the specified academic term.

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_student_academic_record` -- There is one record per student, education organization (usually school or LEA), 
        and academic term.

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        The `k_student` key corresponds to the student's most recent `dim_student` record. For example, if a student was most recently
        enrolled in 2021, then `k_student` will correspond to the 2021 `dim_student record` for all academic record records, regardless
        of the year of the academic record. 

      ##### Example Use Cases:

        To join to the `dim_student` record corresponding to the student's most recent `dim_student` record:
        ```
        SELECT *
        FROM analytics.prod_wh.fct_student_academic_record
        INNER JOIN analytics.prod_wh.dim_student
          ON fct_student_academic_record.k_student = dim_student.k_student
        ```

        To join to the `dim_student` record corresponding to the year of the academic record if it exists:
        ```
        SELECT *
        FROM analytics.prod_wh.fct_student_academic_record
        LEFT JOIN analytics.prod_wh.dim_student
          ON fct_student_academic_record.k_student_xyear = dim_student.k_student_xyear
          AND fct_student_academic_record.school_year = dim_student.school_year
        ```
