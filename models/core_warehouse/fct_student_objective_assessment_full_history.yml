        [fct_student_objective_assessment](#!/model/model.edu_wh.fct_student_objective_assessment) for detail
        on student objective assessments, and see
        [fct_student_assessment_full_history](#!/model/model.edu_wh.fct_student_assessment_full_history)
        for detail on what "full history" means.
