      ##### Overview:
        This table describes the non-offenders associated to disciplinary incidents.
        No behaviors are included in this table because behaviors are only linked
        to offenders.

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_student, k_discipline_incident` -- There is one record per student, year, incident ID, and school.

        description: >
          The role the student took in an incident, such as 'Offender', 'Witness'.
          This comes from a list of participation codes but typically only
          one is associated with a student/incident so we chose the 
          first value for analytical purposes. The values in this table
          will only be codes linked to non-offenders.
