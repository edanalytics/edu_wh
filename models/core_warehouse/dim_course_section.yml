      ##### Overview:
        Defines individual sections of a course, where and when they are offered, and all known characteristics. Note,
        some characteristics are defined at the `course` level. You can find these in [dim_course](#!/model/model.edu_wh.dim_course).

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_course_section` - There is one record per course section.

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        The columns that begin with `is_` e.g. `is_ap` are generated dynamically based on the course characteristics 
        configured in **xwalk_course_level_characteristics**
        To populate these fields, we combine characteristics found in Course, Course Offering, and Sections, because it's
        possible for implementations to populate characterstics at any of these three levels in Ed-Fi. The model that 
        combines these characteristics is [bld_ef3__course_char__combined_long](#!/model/model.edu_wh.bld_ef3__course_char__combined_long)
