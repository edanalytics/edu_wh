      ##### Overview: 
        This fact table contains long student subgroup assignments. It's useful for aggregating analytics
        by the full universe of student groups -- for example, you can see attendance rates by race, gender, and 
        special education status all in one query (see Example Use Cases below).

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_student, k_subgroup` -- There is one record per student, year, and subgroup. Subgroups are defined in [dim_subgroup](/#!/model/model.edu_wh.dim_subgroup).

      ##### Example Use Cases:
        To join `fct_student_subgroup` to other student-level info, simply join on `k_student`:
        ```
          FROM analytics.prod_wh.msr_student_cumulative_attendance att
          JOIN analytics.prod_wh.fct_student_subgroup
            ON att.k_student = fct_student_subgroup.k_student
        ```

        1. Find annual enrollment count by subgroup at North High.
        Note, students count towards any schools they were enrolled at during the year, so if they left North High and went to South High,
        they count toward both schools. The query uses `count(distinct enroll.k_student)` to avoid double-counting students who enrolled 
        at the same school twice in one year.  
          
          ```
            SELECT
              enroll.k_school,
              dim_school.school_id,
              dim_school.school_name,
              enroll.school_year,
              dim_subgroup.k_subgroup,
              dim_subgroup.subgroup_category,
              dim_subgroup.subgroup_value,
              count(distinct enroll.k_student) as total_unique_students
            FROM analytics.prod_wh.fct_student_school_association enroll
            JOIN analytics.prod_wh.fct_student_subgroup
              ON enroll.k_student = fct_student_subgroup.k_student
            JOIN analytics.prod_wh.dim_school
              ON enroll.k_school = dim_school.k_school
            JOIN analytics.prod_wh.dim_subgroup
              ON fct_student_subgroup.k_subgroup = dim_subgroup.k_subgroup
            WHERE dim_school.school_id = '{SCHOOL ID FOR NORTH HIGH}'
            GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
            ORDER by school_year, subgroup_category, subgroup_value;
          ```


        2. Find average annual attendance rates by subgroup at North High.
        Note, `fct_student_subgroup` is a large table (it contains every student x every demographic group), so include filters on school, subgroup, etc. 
        to make your query more efficient.  
          
          ```
            SELECT
              att.k_school,
              dim_school.school_id,
              dim_school.school_name,
              att.school_year,
              dim_subgroup.k_subgroup,
              dim_subgroup.subgroup_category,
              dim_subgroup.subgroup_value,
              sum(days_attended) as total_days_attended,
              sum(days_enrolled) as total_days_enrolled,
              count(distinct att.k_student) as total_unique_students,
              round(100* sum(days_attended) / sum(nullif(days_enrolled, 0)), 2) as attendance_rate
            FROM analytics.prod_wh.msr_student_cumulative_attendance att
            JOIN analytics.prod_wh.fct_student_subgroup
              ON att.k_student = fct_student_subgroup.k_student
            JOIN analytics.prod_wh.dim_school
              ON att.k_school = dim_school.k_school
            JOIN analytics.prod_wh.dim_subgroup
              ON fct_student_subgroup.k_subgroup = dim_subgroup.k_subgroup
            WHERE dim_school.school_id = '{SCHOOL ID FOR NORTH HIGH}'
            GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
            ORDER by school_year, subgroup_category, subgroup_value;
        ```
