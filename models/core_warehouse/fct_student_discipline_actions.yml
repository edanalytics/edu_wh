      ##### Overview:
        This student fact table describes disciplinary actions taken by the school, and their characteristics, including the 
        specific type(s) of discipline (e.g. phone call, suspension).

      ##### Primary Key: 
        `k_student, k_discipline_actions_event, discipline_action` -- There is one record per student, year, action ID, discipline date, and discipline action.

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        Note that `discipline_action` is included in the unique key. In cases where multiple actions are taken, each one recieves its own
        record in this table.

        For instance, a district might respond to an incident with both a phone call home and a suspension. Because the phone call and 
        suspension are stored as separate records, metrics like "count of suspensions" or "count of issued phone calls" are easy to calculate. (see Example Query 1)

        Note that `k_school` is always equal to `k_school_responsibility`. In some cases, there is a separate school referenced, `k_school_assignment`. 
        See the column descriptions below for more info.

        The columns `is_iss`, `is_oss`, `is_exp`, `is_minor`, and `severity_order` are sourced from **xwalk_discipline_actions**, and are useful
        for analytical queries like "count of suspensions". See the column descriptions below for more info.

      ##### Example Queries:
        1. Count the number of Actions, by Type of Action, issued by school A on May 2nd, 2023:
        ```
          WITH counts as (
            select
              fct.k_school,
              fct.discipline_date,
              fct.discipline_action,
              fct.is_iss,
              fct.is_oss,
              count(*) n_actions
            from analytics.prod_wh.fct_student_discipline_actions fct
            group by 1,2,3,4,5
          ) 
          SELECT
            dim_school.school_id,
            dim_school.school_name,
            counts.discipline_date,
            counts.discipline_action,
            counts.is_iss,
            counts.is_oss,
            counts.n_actions
          FROM counts
          JOIN analytics.prod_wh.dim_school 
            on counts.k_school = dim_school.k_school

        ```
