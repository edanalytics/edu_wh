     ##### Overview:
       This fact table provides information on the associations between Staff and Schools. It includes both active and historic associations.

     ##### Primary Key:
       `k_staff, school_year, k_school, program_assignment, staff_classification, begin_date` -- There is one record per staff, year, school, program assignment, classification, and association begin date.
    
     ##### Important Business Rules:
       `staff_classification` and `begin_date` are part of the unique key, so be careful of duplicates when querying staff from this table.  

       `is_active_assignment` is TRUE if:  
       - the assignment is linked to the latest school year in the system,  
       - the `begin_date` is earlier than the current date,  
       - and the `end_date` is either null or later than the current date

     ##### Example Use Cases:
       Find the most recent school assignment for each staff member, and include their email address in the return.
       Note, if the staff member is associated with two schools and they entered both on the same date, this will pick only one of those schools
       ```
        with most_recent_assoc as (
          select *
          from fct_staff_school_association
          -- OPTIONAL FILTER TO ONLY ACTIVE STAFF
          where is_active_assignment
          -- take latest exit, then latest entry, then if still ties, order by k_school to ensure consistency
          qualify 1 = row_number() over(partition by k_staff order by end_date desc, begin_date desc, k_school)
        )
