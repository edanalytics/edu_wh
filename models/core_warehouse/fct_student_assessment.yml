      ##### Overview:
        This fact table defines student assessment records. The wide score results columns are determined based on the `normalized_score_name`
        column from the seed table `xwalk_assessment_scores`.

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_student_assessment` -- There is one record per student-assessment event

      ##### Example of querying "other results":
      Any score that are not included in the wide score results columns are listed in the `v_other_results` column. They can be included
      as wide columns in a query like this:
      ```
          SELECT 
            fsa.*, 
            fsa.v_other_results:"{NAME OF SCORE}"::int as name_of_score
          FROM analytics.prod_wh.fct_student_assessment fsa
          JOIN analytics.prod_wh.dim_assessment da
            ON fsa.k_assessment = da.k_assessment
          WHERE da.assessment_identifier = '{ASSESSMENT IDENTIFIER}'
        ```
