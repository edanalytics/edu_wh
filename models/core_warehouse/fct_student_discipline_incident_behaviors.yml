      ##### Overview:
        This student fact table describes disciplinary incidents and the associated behaviors.
        Only students categorized as offenders of the incident are included in this table, because 
        behaviors are only linked to offenders.

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_student, k_discipline_incident, behavior_type` -- There is one record per student, year, incident ID, school, and behavior.

        description: > 
          Identifier for this discipline incident assigned by the originating software.
      - name: behavior_type
        description: >

      - name: is_offender
        description: >
          Flag for whether or not the student is categorized as an offender
          of the incident. This will always be true for this table.
      - name: severity_order
        description: >
          A ranking number for the severity of behavior, for selecting the most 
          severe. Behaviors are grouped into levels by the 100s, from 0 to 4, and
          then ranked within levels.
          This is controlled in `xwalk_discipline_behaviors.csv`
      - name: is_most_severe_behavior
        description: >
          A flag for whether the discipline behavior is the most severe for a student, 
          discipline_id, and school_id (k_student, k_discipline_incident). 
          In the case of a tie, the first record is chosen.
      - name: participation_code
        description: >
          The role the student took in an incident, such as 'Offender', 'Witness'.
          This comes from a list of participation codes but typically only
          one is associated with a student/incident so we chose the 
          first value for analytical purposes. The values in this table
          will never be codes linked to non-offenders.
