      ##### Overview:
        This dimension table defines students across years and some of their key characteristics.

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_student` -- There is one record per student and year (note that `k_student` is an annualized identifier)

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        `k_student` is annualized, meaning it is a surrogate key for [`student_unique_id` + `school_year`]. This reflects the 
        analytical reality of K-12 accountability measures (most measures are annualized), and the common
        demand to define student characteristics on a yearly basis (e.g. how many students were part of a Special Education Program *this year*).  

        At times it will be useful to run longitudinal analysis linking a student to events across years. For that, use `k_student_xyear`,
        a surrogate key for [`student_unique_id`].
