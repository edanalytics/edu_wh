     **Overview:**
       This fact table provides student program services. It references [stg_ef3__stu_spec_ed__program_services](#!/model/model.edu_edfi_source.stg_ef3__stu_spec_ed__program_services),
      # TODO ADD LINKS TO OTHER PROGRAM SERVICE STAGES

     **Primary Key:**
       `k_student, k_program, program_begin_date, program_service` --
       There is one record per student, program, program start date, and program service

     **Important business rules:**
        - `program_begin_date` is included in the unique key, because a student may be associated with the same program at multiple times, and those associations may have different service designations.
