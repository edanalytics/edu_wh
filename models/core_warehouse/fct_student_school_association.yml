      Student School Association describes student enrollments.

      Note that a student can have multiple enrollments within a year,
      either at multiple schools or even multiple enrollments at the same
      school provided the start dates are different.

      `is_active_enrollment` helps find unclosed enrollments in the current year.
      `is_latest_annual_entry` helps find a unique record for each 
      student-school-year.

      *Primary Key:* `k_student, k_school, school_year, entry_date`
