      ##### Overview:
        This fact table describes student school enrollments. Note that a student can have multiple 
        enrollments within a year. They might be enrolled at multiple schools, or have multiple
        enrollments at the same school, provided the start dates are different. Therefore, it's
        very important to handle duplicates intentionally and carefully when pulling from this table. 
      
      ##### Primary Key: 
        `k_student, k_school, school_year, entry_date` -- There is one record
      per student, school, year, and entry date.

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        `is_active_enrollment` helps find unclosed enrollments in the current year
          
        `is_latest_annual_entry` helps find a unique record for each student-school-year (the latest entry_date is chosen)

      ##### Example Use Cases:
        1. Find the count of distinct students actively enrolled in each grade. `distinct` is used to account for students who may be 
        enrolled at multiple schools. But *caution duplicates*; if for example a student is concurrently enrolled at Maple Middle 
        as an 8th grader and at Hoover High as a 9th grader, they will be counted toward both groups in this query.
        ```
          SELECT
            entry_grade_level,
            count(distinct k_student)
          FROM analytics.prod_wh.fct_student_school_association
          WHERE is_active_enrollment
          GROUP BY 1;
        ```  

            
        2. Find the count of students who were enrolled during February of each school year.
        ```
          SELECT 
            school_year,
            count(distinct k_student)
          FROM analytics.prod_wh.fct_student_school_association
          WHERE true
            -- filter to students who enrolled before the end of february
            AND entry_date < school_year || '-03-01'
            -- and exited after the begining of february (or hasn't yet exited)
            AND (exit_withdraw_date >= school_year || '-02-01' or exit_withdraw_date is null)
          GROUP BY 1
          ORDER BY 1;
        ```
