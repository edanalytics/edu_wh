    description: >
      Course Transcripts contain the full historic record of student
      course grades, though in less detail than `fct_student_grades`.
      Transcripts contain only final grades, while the grade fact may contain
      mid-period progress reports or even in progress grades.

      Rows represent a student's grade and associated details for one
      attempt result in one course at one school during one academic term.

      *Primary Key:* `k_course, k_student_academic_record, course_attempt_result`
