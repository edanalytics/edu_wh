      ##### Overview:
        Course Transcripts contain the full historic record of student course grades, though in less detail
        than [fct_student_grades](#!/model/model.edu_wh.fct_student_grades). Transcripts contain only final 
        grades, while fct_student_grades may contain mid-period progress reports or in-progress grades.  

       Each record represents a student's grade and associated details for one attempt result in one course at
       one school during one academic term.

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_course, k_student_academic_record, course_attempt_result` -- There is one record per course,
        student, education organization (usually school or LEA), academic term, and course attempt (e.g. Pass or Fail).

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        `k_student` is an annualized student identifier, so it will be null unless there is a student record for the relevant school year.

        The `course_attempt_result` attribute is included in the unique key for each record. As a result, there may be multiple records
        with the same values for `k_course` and `k_student_academic_record`, but different values for `course_attempt_result`.
        For example, a student may have both passed and failed a course in a given term. Queries must consider the potential for multiple 
        `course_attempt_result` values per combination of `k_course` and `k_student_academic_record`, and either aggregate the data 
        or choose a specific `course_attempt_result` to avoid incorrect results.

      ##### Example Use Cases:
        To join to `dim_student` without dropping the records where `k_student` is null (i.e., those without `dim_student` data for the year 
        of the transcript record), it is necessary to join on `k_student_xyear` and include some logic to determine which year of student data 
        should be used. One way to do this is using the `is_latest_record` indicator. For example, if a student was most recently enrolled 
        in 2021, then all transcript records - regardless of the year of the data - will be joined to the 2021 `dim_student` record. 
        ```
        SELECT *
        FROM analytics.prod_wh.fct_course_transcripts
        LEFT JOIN analytics.prod_wh.dim_student
          ON fct_course_transcripts.k_student_xyear = dim_student.k_student_xyear
        WHERE dim_student.is_latest_record = True
        ```
