      ##### Overview:
        Course Transcripts contain the full historic record of student course grades, though in less detail
        than [fct_student_grades](#!/model/model.edu_wh.fct_student_grades). Transcripts contain only final grades, while the grade fact may contain
        mid-period progress reports or even in progress grades.  

       Rows represent a student's grade and associated details for one attempt result in one course at
       one school during one academic term.

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_course, k_student_academic_record, course_attempt_result` -- There is one record per course,
        student, education organization (usually school or LEA), academic term, and course attempt (e.g. Pass or Fail).

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        The `course_attempt_result` attribute is included in the unique key for each record. As a result, there may be multiple records
        with the same values for `k_course` and `k_student_academic_record`, but different values for `course_attempt_result`.
        For example, a student may have both passed and failed a course in a given term. Queries must consider the potential for multiple 
        `course_attempt_result` values per combination of `k_course` and `k_student_academic_record`, and either aggregate the data 
        or choose a specific `course_attempt_result` to avoid incorrect results.
