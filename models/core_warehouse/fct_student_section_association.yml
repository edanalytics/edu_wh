      ##### Overview:
        This fact table describes student section enrollments. Note that there can be multiple records per student+section, e.g., if they left the section and later re-enrolled with a different begin date.

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_student, k_course_section, begin_date` -- There is one record per student, section, and begin date.

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        `is_active_enrollment` helps find unclosed enrollments in the current year
