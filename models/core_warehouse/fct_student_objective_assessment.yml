      ##### Overview:
        This fact table defines student objective assessment records.

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_student_objective_assessment` -- There is one record per student-objective assessment event

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        The wide score results columns are determined based on the `normalized_score_name`
        column from the seed table `xwalk_assessment_scores`.

        `k_student` is an annualized student identifier, so it will be null unless there is a student record for the relevant school year.
        We INCLUDE records with null `k_student` to enable analysis of current students' full history of assessments. Therefore,
        users CAN use `fct_student_objective_assessment` to answer "What is the longitudinal trend in test scores for my current students?"
        
        However, `k_student_xyear` is a x-year student identifier, and we EXCLUDE records where `k_student_xyear` is null,
        because we have no way to identify the students. Therefore, users CAN NOT use `fct_student_objective_assessment` to answer 
        "What is the longitudinal trend in test scores for students who were english learners at the time of the test?",
        UNLESS every year of assessment data has a corresponding & complete set of identifying data in `dim_student`.
        Often, this means you should only run longitudinal analysis on years for which you have populated an Ed-Fi ODS, 
        or a supplementary data source.
