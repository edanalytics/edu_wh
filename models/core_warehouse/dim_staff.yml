     ##### Overview:
       This dimension table defines staff and the characteristics unique to them, like name, email_address, etc.

     ##### Primary Key:
       `k_staff` -- There is one record per staff member

     ##### Important Business Rules:
       If the staff member has multiple email addresses in the ODS, this table selects one, using these rules:  
       1. Never select if Ed-Fi Staff.ElectronicMail.DoNotPublishIndicator is True
       2. Select address with ElectronicMailType = 'Work' if exists
       3. Else, select first address found for this k_staff in [stg_ef3__staffs__emails](#!/model/model.edu_edfi_source.stg_ef3__staffs__emails)
