      ##### Overview:
        This fact table contains student course grades by grading period within the school year.
        Note, not all grading periods indicate final grades, so be careful when aggregating
        grades across grading periods.

      ##### Primary Key: 
        `k_student, k_school, k_course_section, k_grading_period, grade_type` -- There is one 
         record per student, school, course section, grading period, and grade type.

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        Note that `grade_type` is part of the Primary Key, meaning a student
        may have multiple grades for the same course in the same grading period,
        provided they have different grade types.

        Several columns e.g. `is_dorf`, `grade_sort_index` are sourced from **xwalk_letter_grades**.
        See column descriptions below for more detail.
