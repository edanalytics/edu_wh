    description: >
      Student course grades by grading period within the school year.

      Note that not all grading periods indicate final grades, so averages 
      across grading periods may double-count some periods of time.

      Note that `grade_type` is part of the Primary Key, meaning a student
      may have multiple grades for the same course in the same grading period,
      provided they have different grade types.


      *Primary Key:* `k_student, k_school, k_course_section, k_grading_period, grade_type`
