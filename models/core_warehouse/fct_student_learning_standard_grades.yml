      ##### Overview:
        This fact table contains student learning standard grades by grading period within the school year.
        Note, not all grading periods indicate final grades, so be careful when aggregating
        grades across grading periods.

      ##### Primary Key: 
        `k_student, k_school, k_course_section, k_grading_period, k_learning_standard` -- There is one 
         record per student, school, course section, grading period, and learning standard.

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        Note that `k_learning_standard` is part of the Primary Key, meaning a student
        may have multiple learning standard grades for the same course in the same grading period,
        provided they have different learning standards. Additionally, this model has a similar natural key 
        to fct_student_grades, it is sourced from the same Ed-Fi Resource. 

      ##### Example Query:
        To find the learning standard grades for one particular student, course section, school, and grading period:
        ```
          FROM analytics.prod_wh.fct_student_learning_standard_grades
          WHERE k_student = [replace with k_student]
            AND k_course_section = [replace with k_course_section]
            AND k_school = [replace with k_school]
            AND k_grading_period = [replace with k_grading_period];
        ```

      {{ doc(var('edu:custom_docs:fct_student_learning_standard_grades')) if var('edu:custom_docs:fct_student_learning_standard_grades', '') }}
