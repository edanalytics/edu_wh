    description: >
      This table provides a summary of student discipline incidents
      by linking discipline incidents to all associated discipline 
      actions, regardless of whether the discipline actions belong 
      to different discipline action events. To keep the grain at a single 
      student and discipline incident but also represent the multiple 
      behaviors and actions, we included both as lists. Additionally, 
      we included the most severe discipline action (across all 
      associated discipline action events) and the most severe behavior 
      (for a discipline incident).

      Rows represent a student and discipline incident.

      *Primary Key:* k_student, k_student_xyear, k_discipline_incident
