      ##### Overview:
        Represents a historical record of student grade point averages, including cumulative and non-cumulative measures.

      ##### Primary Key:
        `k_student_academic_record, gpa_type, is_cumulative` -- There is one record per student, education organization (usually school 
        or LEA), academic term, GPA type (such as weighted or unweighted), and cumulative/non-cumulative indicator.

      ##### Important Business Rules:
        `k_student` is an annualized student identifier, so it will be null unless there is a student record for the relevant school year.

      ##### Example Use Cases:
        To join to `dim_student` without dropping the records where `k_student` is null (i.e., those without `dim_student` data for the
        year of the GPA record), it is necessary to join on `k_student_xyear` and include some logic to determine which year of student 
        data should be used. One way to do this is using the `is_latest_record` indicator. For example, if a student was most recently
        enrolled in 2021, then all GPA records - regardless of the year of the data - will be joined to the 2021 `dim_student` record.
