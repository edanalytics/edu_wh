    description: >
      This table provides a summary of student discipline action events
      by linking discipline action events (defined as a discipline action
      id and a discipline date) to all associated behaviors, regardless
      of whether the behaviors belong to different incident IDs. To 
      keep the grain at a single student and discipline action event but 
      also represent the multiple behaviors and actions, we included both as 
      lists. Additionally, we included the most severe discipline action 
      (for a discipline action event) and the most severe behavior (across 
      all associated incident IDs).

      Rows represent a student and discipline action event.

      *Primary Key:* k_student, k_student_xyear, k_discipline_actions_event
