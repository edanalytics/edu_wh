     ##### Overview:
       This fact table provides student daily attendance, computed using full-day attendance as reported in `studentSchoolAttendanceEvents`.

     ##### Primary Key:
       k_student, k_school, calendar_date -- There is one record per student, school, and calendar date.

     ##### Important business rules:
        - "chronic absence" is calculated here for each student & day, and reflected in boolean column `is_chronic_absentee`.
        It marks a student as a chronic absentee if their  **cumulative** attendance rate is less than or equal to {{ var('edu:attendance:chronic_absence_threshold') }};
        the threshold value {{ var('edu:attendance:chronic_absence_threshold') }} is defined in dbt_project.yml --> `edu:attendance:chronic_absence_threshold`.
        It also will only count students who have been enrolled at the school for at least {{ var('edu:attendance:chronic_absence_min_days') }} days;
        the threshold value {{ var('edu:attendance:chronic_absence_min_days') }} is defined in dbt_project.yml --> `edu:attendance:chronic_absence_min_days`

        - "absentee category" is calculated here for each student & day, and reflected in `absentee_category_rank` (integer) and `absentee_category_label` (string).
        It categorizes students using their **cumulative** attendance rate in comparison to thresholds set by the seed table `absentee_categories`.
